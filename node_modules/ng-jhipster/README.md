## Development setup

You need NodeJS and NPM.

### Fork the ng-jhipster project

Go to the [ng-jhipster project](https://github.com/jhipster/ng-jhipster) and click on the "fork" button. You can then clone your own fork of the project, and start working on it.

[Please read the Github forking documentation for more information](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo)

### Build

Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.

Make some changes, run `npm run test` to run both eslint/tslint and unit tests.

Build the library with `npm run build`.

Package the library by running `npm pack` in the `dist` directory. This will create an archive `ng-jhipster-vX.Y.Z.tgz`.

For testing, you will want to integrate this archive into an application generated by JHipster.

Go to your generated JHipster application and run...

    npm install path/to/ng-jhipster/dist/ng-jhipster-vX.Y.Z.tgz

...so that your JHipster application uses the content of this archive as `ng-jhipster` dependency which is located in `node_modules/ng-jhipster`.

### Quick development

You can quickly test library changes in Angular application generated by JHipster in the following manner.

1. Generate Angular application using JHipster generator.

2. Actions in the `ng-jhipster` project.

    - In the `ng-package.dev.json` change the value of the `dest` to some subfolder inside generated project, for example if using **Gradle** or **skipping server** then you can use `GeneratedAppRootFolder/build/dist/ng-jhipster` and if using **Maven** then use `target` subfolder instead of `build`.  
       For example, if the generated app and the `ng-jhipster` are siblings in the disk then you can use:

        ```
        "dest": "../generated-app-root-folder-name/build/dist/ng-jhipster",
        ```

        One note about this change. As Angular framework architecture excpects that in building app all blocks of the application are inside app root folder then you can't skip this step. If you don't do this change and in the generated app `tsconfig.json` file refer to `ng-jhipster` default destination folder like this `"ng-jhipster": ["../ng-jhipster/dist"]` then runtime errors will occur on running app.

    - Run `npm run build:dev`

3. Actions in the generated application.

    - In the `tsconfig.json` file, add the following entry into `compilerOptions.paths`:

        ```
        "ng-jhipster": ["build/dist/ng-jhipster"]
        ```

    - Optional step. If you are using some other subfolder than `build` or `target` for `ng-jhipster` build destination and this folder is not in `.eslintignore` then add this folder there (this suppresses ESLint errors for compiled `ng-jhipster` bundle)

    - Run `npm start`

Now on every change in `ng-jhipster` the following will happen automatically:

-   `ng-jhipster` rebuilds
-   generated app rebuilds using freshly built local `ng-jhipster`
-   generated app is reloaded in the browser and you can see and test changes made in the `ng-jhipster`
